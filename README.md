This is the repository we will be using for EECS 448 - Applied Machine Learning for Modeling Human Behavior.
Authors: Amrita Thirumalai, Matt Conrad, Bowen Yi, Joseph Li and Hriday Chhabria

To run any of these files, you want to create a python virtual environment. EECS 485 has a great tutorial on how to do so. 
Once you have created a virtual environment use "pip install -r requirements.txt" to run all python files in this directory.
